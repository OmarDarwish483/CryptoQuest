## üìú Description

Crypto Quest is an interactive text-based adventure game designed to teach cryptography through engaging puzzles and challenges. In this exciting quest, you take on the role of a codebreaker navigating through various rooms, each containing unique cryptographic puzzles. Your mission is to solve these puzzles and uncover a mysterious secret. Each room presents encrypted messages that, when decrypted, reveal clues to help you progress further.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Rooms**: Each room offers unique cryptographic challenges.
- **Various Encryption Methods**: Includes puzzles based on Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, and more.
- **Collectible Tools**: Gather cryptographic tools and keys to aid in solving puzzles.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Challenges become increasingly complex as you advance.
- **Interactive Commands**: Use commands like `look`, `take`, `use`, and `solve` to interact with the game.
- **Educational Content**: Learn about different cryptographic techniques and their historical context.
